# 2023-Sales-and-Customer-Insights-A-Tableau-Dashboard-Analysis

I created a Tableau project to analyze and visualize sales data for 2023 using a sample dataset. The dataset consisted of four key components: Orders, Products, Location, and Customers. My goal was to develop dynamic and interactive dashboards that provide insights into various sales metrics and customer behavior, while also allowing for comparisons with data from previous years (2020-2022).

Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
I identified and developed several KPIs to track the performance of the business:

Total Sales: The overall revenue generated during 2023.
Profit: The net profit after accounting for all expenses.
Quantity: The total number of products sold.
Sales per Customer: The average amount spent by each customer.
Orders: The total number of orders placed.
Total Customers: The number of unique customers during the year.
Visualizations
To better understand the data, I created the following visualizations:

Customer Distribution Chart (Bar Chart): This chart shows the distribution of customers across different categories, helping identify the segments that contribute the most to sales.
Top Customers by Profit (Table): A ranked list of customers based on the profit they generated, highlighting the most valuable customers.
Sales Profit Trend Over Time Chart: A line chart showing the trends in sales and profit over the course of the year, allowing for the identification of seasonal patterns or anomalies.
Sales & Profit by Subcategory Chart: A detailed breakdown of sales and profit by product subcategory, helping to identify the most and least profitable product lines.
Comparative Analysis
Given that I had data from previous years (2020-2022), I incorporated comparative analysis into the project. All KPIs were compared against previous years to assess growth or decline, providing a clear picture of performance trends over time.

Dashboards
To present the data in an accessible and actionable format, I created two dashboards:

Sales Dashboard:

Total Sales
Profit
Quantity
Sales Profit Trend Over Time Chart
Sales & Profit by Subcategory Charts
This dashboard provides a comprehensive overview of sales performance, helping stakeholders quickly assess the overall health of the business.

Customer Dashboard:

Total Customers
Sales per Customer
Orders
Customer Distribution Chart
Top 10 Customers by Profit Chart
The customer dashboard focuses on customer behavior and profitability, enabling deeper insights into customer segments and identifying high-value customers.
